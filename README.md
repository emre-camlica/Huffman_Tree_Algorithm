# Huffman_Tree_Algorithm
A Huffman Tree algorithm I designed as a homework in Data Structures Course, using a given templete.
The structs file includes the functions of priority queue and tree classes.
In the huffman file, functions of the Huffmann algorithm are implemented.
The main function was provided to us.
